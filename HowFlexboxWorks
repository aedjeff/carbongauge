How Flexbox Works?

Flexbox is a layout mode in CSS that is used to arrange a set of block items in
a flexible structure.
Flexbox can be used to direct its items either along the row or along the column
It is primarily used to distribute the available space to the items contained 
thus forming the backbone of responsive UI design in CSS
